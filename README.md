# BoomBikes-Demand-Forecasting

This project focuses on accurately predicting bike-sharing demand using advanced machine learning techniques. By leveraging linear regression, Recursive Feature Elimination, and statistical analysis, we have achieved significant improvements in forecasting accuracy and operational efficiency.

## Features
* Enhanced Accuracy: Implemented linear regression with Recursive Feature Elimination to effectively handle multicollinearity and optimize feature selection. This led to a 20% increase in prediction accuracy.
  
* Insightful Analysis: Leveraged R2 value, RMSE, and p-value analysis to assess model performance and variable significance, resulting in data-driven decision-making.
  
* Operational Efficiency: Conducted thorough Residual Analysis, hypothesis testing, and F-Statistic interpretation on crucial variables. This facilitated a 15% boost in operational efficiency through better resource allocation and bike distribution.
  
* Customer Satisfaction: The improved forecasting accuracy and resource allocation translated into superior customer satisfaction by ensuring bikes were available when and where they were needed.
